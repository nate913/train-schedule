I created a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host train data including: first train time, frequency of train, train name and destination. A user can submit this information on the application and it is saved to Firebase.The website provides up-to-date information about the various trains including: their name, destination, frequency, arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.
